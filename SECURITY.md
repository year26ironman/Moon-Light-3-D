This document outlines security procedures and general policies for the Midnight Foundation.

This policy adheres to the [vulnerability management guidance](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/security)
for Linux Foundation projects.

## Disclosing a security issue

The Midnight foundation takes all security issues seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed
through our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/midnightntwrk). If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Midnight Foundation
owned repository, *please report it using GitHub's private vulnerability reporting* and not through public GitHub issues. To learn more about GitHub's
private vulnerability reporting and how to submit a vulnerability report, please review [GitHub's documentation on private reporting](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- The repository name or URL
- Type of issue (buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of the source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any particular configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue
- This information will help us triage your report more quickly

A maintainer will acknowledge the report within three (3) business days, and
will send a more detailed response within an additional three (3) business days
indicating the next steps in handling your report.

If you've been unable to successfully draft a vulnerability report via GitHub
or have not received a response during the alloted response window, please
reach out via the [Midnight foundation security contact email](mailto:security@midnight.foundation).

After the initial reply to your report, the maintainers will endeavor to keep
you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask
for additional information or guidance.

Thank you for improving the security of Midnight. We appreciate your dedication to responsible disclosure and will
make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Vulnerability management

When the maintainers receive a disclosure report, they will assign it to a
primary handler.

This person will coordinate the fix and release process, which involves the
following steps:

- confirming the issue
- determining affected versions of the project
- auditing code to find any potential similar problems
- preparing fixes for all releases under maintenance

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Suggesting changes

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit an
issue or pull request.
